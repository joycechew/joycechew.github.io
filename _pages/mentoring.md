## REUs (UCLA)

* 2022: AI for Holocaust Studies (with Michael Lindstrom, Michael Perlmutter, Todd Presner, and Deanna Needell)

## [Directed Reading Program at UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~drp/)

The Directed Reading Program pairs graduate students with undergraduate students who want to explore an area of mathematics that is not typically covered in the standard undergraduate mathematics classes at UCLA. Here are the projects I have supervised:

* Fall 2021: Convex optimization
* Winter 2022: Introduction to Kaczmarz methods (two students)
* Spring 2022: Continued exploration of Kaczmarz methods (two students), Introduction to matrix factorizations and algorithms

## Women in Math at UCLA

The Women in Math mentorship program pairs female graduate students and postdocs with female undergraduate students to give support and advice. I have been a mentor for one year, mentoring a student interested in mathematics education. We meet several times throughout the year, discussing topics such as course selection, summer programs, and applying to graduate school.
