## NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
I received the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship as a senior undergrad in 2020, and it has opened many doors for me. When I was writing my application, I found it helpful to read the advice of others and previous successful applications. Here, I provide some of my thoughts on the process, link to advice that was helpful to me, and provide my application materials in hopes of empowering future applicants. Please feel free to email me if you would like to discuss any of this!

### My thoughts

### Other NSF GRFP advice
[Alex Lang's website](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship) - The specifics were last updated to reflect the 2018 solicitation, so be sure to read the current solicitation carefully, but he has good general advice. He also links to several other pages, and most helpfully, hosts a database of _many_ past winners and honorable mentions.

[Mallory Ladd's website](http://www.malloryladd.com/nsf-grfp-advice.html) - There is a very nice suggested timeline here, though to be honest, I did not come close to sticking to it. She also provides some past successful applications, though none are in mathematical sciences.

### My application materials

[Personal statement](https://joycechew.github.io/files/JAC_NSF_personal_statement.pdf) \
[Research statement](https://joycechew.github.io/files/JAC_NSF_research_statement.pdf) - No, I did not end up working in this area in graduate school. \
[Reviews](https://joycechew.github.io/files/JAC_NSF_reviews.pdf) - I've been told that NSF GRFP reviews are generally helpful, but I did not find mine particularly illuminating. However, they may be helpful to you.
