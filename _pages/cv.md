Education
======
* Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles, 2025 (expected)
  * Area Exams (passed Spring 2021):
    * Numerical Analysis
    * Optimization/Numerical Linear Algebra
* M.A. in Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles, 2022
* B.S. in Mathematics (Honors), Calvin University, 2020
* B.A. in Chemistry, Calvin University, 2020

Research experience
======
* June 2021 - present: Graduate Student Researcher
  * University of California, Los Angeles Department of Mathematics
  * Research interests:
    * Numerical linear algebra
    * Stochastic iterative methods
    * Graph learning

* June 2019 - August 2019: NSF REU
  * Cornell University Department of Mathematics
  * Studied the equilibrium configurations of flexible helical springs using optimal control. Developed numerical methods to find unstable configurations and demonstrated the presence of saddle-node bifurcations in the equilibrium configurations of twisted springs.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Andy Borum

* May 2018 - September 2020: Undergraduate Researcher
  * Calvin University Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
  * Projects:
    * _Development of a parallelized, high-throughput website for equilibrium binding analysis:_ Applied several classes of optimization algorithms to the simultaneous determination of reaction stoichiometry and binding constants of equilibrium systems of host-guest binding. Evaluated speed, convergence, and accuracy to devise a new hybrid algorithm. Currently implementing this new methodology in a supercomputer software package to facilitate fast, high-throughput analysis via a website interface.
    * _Mathematical and computational analysis of 1:1 equilibrium binding:_ Wrote Monte Carlo simulations to determine the robustness of global analysis for determination of binding constants of 1:1 host-guest equilibrium binding. Numerically demonstrated the benefits of using mathematically-derived optimal parameters for the titration experiment.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Douglas A. Vander Griend

* May 2017 - August 2017: Undergraduate Researcher
  * Calvin University Department of Mathematics and Statistics
  * Worked towards a new proof of the 3-variable Moreno-Socias conjecture to prove the generalized conjecture. Used computer algebra systems to compute Grobner bases of generic ideals. Formulated a conjecture characterizing generic Grobner bases and proved the 2-variable case.
  * Supervisor: Dr. James Turner
