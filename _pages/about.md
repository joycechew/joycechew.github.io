I am a rising third year PhD student studying applied mathematics at UCLA. Previously, I attended Calvin University, where I obtained bachelor's degrees in mathematics and chemistry, with a minor in computer science. I am broadly interested in the mathematics of data science; I am currently working on developing manifold- and graph-based methods for high dimensional data, with biological applications.
