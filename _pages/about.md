I am a third year PhD student studying applied mathematics at UCLA. I work with Professor Deanna Needell, and I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Previously, I attended Calvin University, where I obtained bachelor's degrees in mathematics and chemistry, with a minor in computer science. I am broadly interested in the mathematics of data science; I am currently working on various projects related to machine learning on manifolds. I am also interested in issues of bias in machine learning.
