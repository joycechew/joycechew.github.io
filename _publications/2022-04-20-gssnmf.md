We present a novel Guided Semi-Supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (GSSNMF) that incorporates class labels and seed features to perform both classification and clustering. We evaluate the performance of GSSNMF for these two tasks using the 20 Newsgroups dataset, as well as text data from the California Innocence Project.
